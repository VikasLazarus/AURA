<p class="w3-text-gray">The <strong>Jakhoo Ropeway</strong> was inaugurated in 2017 by then Chief Minister Virbhadra Singh after a decade-long project that faced several challenges including environmental clearances and safety evaluations. Constructed by Jagsons International Limited on a public-private partnership model, the ropeway was designed to facilitate easy access to Jakhoo Temple, avoiding the strenuous climb that used to take visitors up to 40 minutes on foot. The project cost around Rs 40 crore and marked a significant boost for Shimla’s tourism industry.</p>
