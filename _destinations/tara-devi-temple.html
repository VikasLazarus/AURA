<h2 class="w3-large w3-text-dark-gray">Rich History Spanning Over 250 Years</h2>
<p class="w3-text-gray">The origins of Tara Devi Temple trace back more than <strong>two and a half centuries</strong>. It was founded by the <strong>Sen dynasty kings</strong>, rulers of the erstwhile Keonthal State. According to legend, <strong>King Bhupendra Sen</strong> brought a <strong>wooden idol</strong> of Goddess Tara from West Bengal after experiencing a divine dream. In this dream, the goddess and her guardians <strong>Lord Hanuman</strong> and <strong>Bhairav</strong> asked him to build a temple at this sacred location so that people could seek her blessings.</p>
<p class="w3-text-gray">Initially, the temple was established at a lower site, but later, based on a vision received by <strong>King Balbir Sen</strong>, the temple was relocated to the hilltop of <strong>Tarav Parvat</strong>. In 1825, a magnificent idol made of <strong>Ashtadhatu</strong> (a blend of eight precious metals) was ceremoniously installed. The Sen dynasty has continued venerating this family deity annually, especially during the <strong>Ashtami day of Sharad Navratri</strong>, when a festive fair is also organized.</p>
