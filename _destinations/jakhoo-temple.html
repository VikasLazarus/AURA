    <p class="w3-text-gray"><strong>Jakhoo Temple</strong> is one of <strong>Shimla's most revered landmarks</strong>, perched atop <strong>Jakhoo Hill</strong>, the highest peak in Shimla at an altitude of 2,455 meters (8,054 feet). Dedicated to <strong>Lord Hanuman</strong>, this ancient temple blends <strong>rich mythology, spiritual significance, breathtaking views, and cultural heritage</strong> into a unique destination beloved by devotees and tourists alike.</p>

    <h2 class="w3-large w3-text-dark-gray">Mythological and Historical Significance</h2>
    <p class="w3-text-gray">The temple’s origins are deeply rooted in Hindu mythology and the <strong>Ramayana epic</strong>. It is believed that <strong>Lord Hanuman</strong> stopped at Jakhoo Hill while on his quest to find the <strong>Sanjeevani herb</strong> to save Lakshmana, Lord Rama’s brother, who was gravely injured during a battle with the demon king Ravana. Unable to identify the herb, Hanuman lifted the entire mountain and flew back to the battlefield. On his return, he rested on the hilltop, where the weight of his presence is said to have <strong>flattened the summit</strong>.</p>
    <p class="w3-text-gray">The temple was subsequently built around the site believed to hold the footprints of Hanuman, making it a place of deep devotional importance. Legend speaks of the sage Yaksha who, saddened by Hanuman's brief visit, erected the temple to honor the deity, and a self-manifested idol of Hanuman is said to have appeared in the sanctum [web:11][web:12][web:15].</p>
